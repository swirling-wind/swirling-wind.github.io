## 1. Computer Graphics (COMP0027)

###  Tasks
* Calculate 3D primitives using matrix
* Rasterization Toy Renderer
* Ray Trace Toy Renderer + **Monte-Carlo** Simulation
* Scene Description

### Assessment
* By 3 Course Tutors (Prof. Tobias Ritschel, etc.)
* Accomplish 3 Coursework (33.3% each)
> (a) Utilize OpenGL ES to create primitives, set materials, cast shadows, add reflections and refractions with Fresnel  
   
> (b) Utilize OpenGL ES to create a rasterization pipeline, which enables projection, clipping, interpolation, z-buffering, and animation  
  
> (c) Implement path tracing with OpenGL ES

### Preparations
> For Learning OpenGL ES
* [Learn OpenGL, extensive tutorial resource for learning Modern OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
  
> For Calculating 3D primitives and Scene Description
* [GAMES: Graphics And Mixed Environment Symposium](https://games-cn.org/previouswebinar-ppt/)

> For Ray Tracing and Monte-Carlo Simulation
* [Ray Tracing in One Weekend - The Book Series](https://raytracing.github.io/)
* [Physically Based Rendering - From Theory To Implementation](https://pbrt.org/)

## 2. Machine Vision (COMP0137)

### Tasks
* Probabilistic Models for recognition and segmentation by pixels
* Homography for creating panoramas
* Pose recovery and 3D model rebuilding
* Kalman filter and Condensation algorithm for visual tracking, using Factored Sampling


### Assessment
* By Prof. BROSTOW, Gabriel
* Examination (80%) + 2 courseworks (10% each, several labs included)
> Utilizle Python to realize Pixel-by-Pixel classification by implementing Mixture of Gaussian Model, calculating likelihood of pixels  
  
> Calculate homography that best maps two sets of points to create panoramas and 3D pose of planes
  
> Calculate the appearing points based on camera's geometry to draw a wirefram cube on an augmented reality marker
  
> Utilize Python to estimate the posterior probabilities with Condensation algorithm to help track objects
