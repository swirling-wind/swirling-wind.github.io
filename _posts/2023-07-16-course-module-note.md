# Compulsory Modules

## 1. Computer Graphics (COMP0027)

###  Tasks
* Calculate 3D primitives using matrix
* Rasterization Toy Renderer
* Ray Trace Toy Renderer + _Monte-Carlo_ Simulation
* Scene Description

### Assessment
* By 3 Course Tutors (Prof. Tobias Ritschel, etc.)
* Accomplish 3 Coursework (33.3% each)
> (a) Use GLSL ES to create primitives, set materials, cast shadows, add reflections and refractions with Fresnel  
> (b) Use GLSL ES to create a rasterization pipeline, which enables projection, clipping, interpolation, z-buffering, and animation  
> (c) Implement path tracing with OpenGL ES

### Preparations
> For Learning GLSL ES
* TODO!
  
> For Calculating 3D primitives and Scene Description
* [GAMES: Graphics And Mixed Environment Symposium](https://games-cn.org/previouswebinar-ppt/)

> For Ray Tracing and Monte-Carlo Simulation
* [Ray Tracing in One Weekend - The Book Series](https://raytracing.github.io/)
* [Physically Based Rendering - From Theory To Implementation](https://pbrt.org/)
